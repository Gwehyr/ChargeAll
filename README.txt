ChargeAll is a plugin for the game Minecraft. 
It is my first plugin based of an example made using a tutorial. 
I originally made this a few years ago but never uploaded it.
This is also my first Git and Github repository.

ChargeAll adds two new commands to minecraft. one that sets all creepers that spawn to spawn as charged creepers, and another that sets all creepers to spawn as normal creepers.
that is it so far. might add a command to set spawns back to normal by disableing hte listner. knowing me, im probably not going to remember to.
